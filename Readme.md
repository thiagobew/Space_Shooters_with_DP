# Final project for a university course in Operating Systems using a thread/syncronization library.
This repository will serve as practice implementing design patterns, refactoring the initial code and possibly extending functionalities.

# To run the program, execute make and run ./main.
# Diagrams were developed using Visual Paradigm. The project is in the diagrams folder. 
The software must be downloaded in order to open the project file since it has its own extension (.vpp).
